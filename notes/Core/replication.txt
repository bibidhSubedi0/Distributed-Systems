Replication Fundamentals
    -> SMR State machine Replication
    -> Leader-based vs leaderless Replication
    -> Synchronous(leader waits for replicas to confrim before ack write) vs asynchronous

1. Single-Leader Replication (Primary-Replica)
    Architecture: One node (leader) handles all writes. Replicas (followers) copy the leaderâ€™s data.
    Writes: Only go to the leader.
    Reads: Can go to leader or followers (but followers might lag).
    Failover: If leader fails, a new leader is elected.
    
    Pros:
    Simple to reason about.
    Strong consistency (if all reads go to leader).
    Cons:

    Leader is a single point of write bottleneck.
    Failover can be slow/complex.

2. Multi-Leader Replication
    Architecture: Multiple nodes accept writes. Replicate changes to each other.
    Use case: Geo-distributed systems needing local writes.
    Pros:

    High availability for writes.
    Local writes in different regions.
    Cons:

    Conflict resolution required (concurrent changes).
    Complexity increases.

3. Leaderless Replication
    Architecture: Any node can handle writes; data is replicated to N nodes.
    Used by: Dynamo, Cassandra
    Pros:

    Highly available.
    No single leader bottleneck.
    Cons:

    Consistency is eventual.
    Read/write quorum logic is needed.
