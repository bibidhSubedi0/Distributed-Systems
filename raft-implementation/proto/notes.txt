I'll elaborate on each service and how they work together in Raft consensus. Let's break it down:

1. Leader Election Services (Core Raft)
rpc RequestVote(RequestVoteRequest) returns (RequestVoteResponse)

- When Used: When a follower becomes a candidate and starts an election
- Important Fields:
  - Term number (for logical clock)
  - Candidate's ID
  - Last log index and term (for log consistency check)
- Flow:
  - Follower's election timeout expires
  - Converts to candidate, increments term
  - Sends RequestVote to all other servers
  - Other servers check their logs and current term
  - Grant or deny vote based on log up-to-date check

rpc AppendEntries(AppendEntriesRequest) returns (AppendEntriesResponse)

- Used for:
  - Heartbeat (empty entries) to maintain leadership
  - Log replication (with entries) to sync state
- Key Fields:
  - Leader's term
  - Previous log index/term for consistency
  - Entries to append
  - Leader's commit index
- Flow:
  - Leader sends AppendEntries periodically
  - Followers validate log consistency
  - Followers append new entries if valid
  - Update commit index if leader says so

2. Log Replication Details
rpc ReplicateLog(ReplicateLogRequest) returns (ReplicateLogResponse)

- Purpose:
  - Efficient batching of log entries
  - Handling log conflicts
  - Ensuring consistency
- Process:
  1. Leader receives client request
  2. Appends to own log
  3. Sends ReplicateLog to all followers
  4. Waits for majority response
  5. Commits entry if majority received
  6. Notifies client of success

3. State Transfer (For Log Compaction)
rpc InstallSnapshot(stream SnapshotChunk) returns (SnapshotResponse)

- When Used:
  - Follower too far behind
  - Log compaction occurred
  - New server joining
- Streaming Process:
  1. Break snapshot into chunks
  2. Stream chunks to follower
  3. Follower reconstructs state
  4. Update follower's log

4. Client Interaction Layer
rpc ClientRequest(Command) returns (CommandResponse)

- Handles:
  - Write requests (need consensus)
  - Read requests (can be from leader only)
  - Leader forwarding
- Flow:
  1. Client sends request to any server
  2. If follower, redirect to leader
  3. Leader processes command
  4. Replicates to followers
  5. Responds to client

5. Cluster Management
rpc AddServer(AddServerRequest) returns (AddServerResponse)
rpc RemoveServer(RemoveServerRequest) returns (RemoveServerResponse)

- Membership Changes:
  - Joint consensus approach
  - Two-phase commit process
  - Safe configuration transitions
- Process:
  1. New config proposed
  2. Joint consensus phase
  3. New config committed
  4. Old config retired

6. State Query and Monitoring
rpc GetState(StateRequest) returns (StateResponse)

- Provides:
  - Current role (Leader/Follower/Candidate)
  - Term information
  - Leader ID
  - Log status
  - Cluster health

Interaction Flow Example:
1. System Start:
   - All nodes start as followers
   - Election timeout begins

2. Leader Election:
   
   Follower A (timeout) → Candidate
   ├─► RequestVote to B
   ├─► RequestVote to C
   └─► RequestVote to D
   

3. Log Replication:
   
   Client → Leader
   ├─► AppendEntries to Follower1
   ├─► AppendEntries to Follower2
   └─► Response to Client
   

4. Recovery Scenario:
   
   Lagging Follower
   ├─► Failed AppendEntries
   ├─► InstallSnapshot from Leader
   └─► Resume normal operation
   

Important Implementation Details:
1. Timeouts:
   - Election timeout (randomized)
   - Heartbeat interval
   - RPC timeouts

2. State Machine:
   
   Follower → Candidate → Leader
        ↑          ↓
        └──────────┘
   

3. Safety Properties:
   - Election Safety: one leader per term
   - Log Matching: same index = same term
   - Leader Completeness: committed entries stay committed

Would you like me to dive deeper into any particular aspect of these interactions or explain more about a specific service?
